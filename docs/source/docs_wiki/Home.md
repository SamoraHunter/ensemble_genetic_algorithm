Welcome to the **Ensemble Genetic Algorithm** project wiki!

This project provides a robust framework for evolving machine learning ensembles for binary classification problems using genetic algorithms. It's designed to be extensible, highly configurable, and flexible, allowing users to customize base learners, genetic algorithm hyperparameters, and feature space exploration.

## Key Features

-   **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to search for optimal ensembles of machine learning classifiers.
-   **Extensible Base Learners**: Easily integrate various machine learning algorithms as base learners.
-   **Configurable Hyperparameters**: Fine-tune genetic algorithm parameters (e.g., population size, generations) and base learner configurations.
-   **Feature Space Exploration**: Supports grid search over feature spaces and feature transformations.
-   **GPU Acceleration**: Optional GPU support for PyTorch-based models.
-   **Comprehensive Setup**: Includes a `setup.sh` script for automated environment creation and dependency installation.
