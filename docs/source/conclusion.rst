Conclusion
==========

You have now explored the comprehensive documentation for the **Ensemble Genetic Algorithm** project.

Throughout these guides, you have learned how to:

-   Prepare your data and set up the environment.
-   Configure and run complex hyperparameter search experiments.
-   Interpret the rich visualizations to understand model performance and hyperparameter impact.
-   Evaluate the final, best-performing ensembles on unseen data.
-   Extend the framework by adding new base learners.

We hope this documentation provides you with the confidence and knowledge to leverage this powerful tool for your own binary classification problems. The framework is designed to be both a robust research tool and a flexible platform for experimentation.

Next Steps
----------

-   **Apply it to your data**: The best way to learn is by doing. Adapt the ``example_usage.ipynb`` notebook for your own dataset.
-   **Contribute**: We welcome contributions! Whether it's reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting a pull request, please visit our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/SamoraHunter/ensemble_genetic_algorithm>`_.
-   **Ask Questions**: If you run into issues not covered in the troubleshooting guide, feel free to open an issue on GitHub.

Thank you for using the Ensemble Genetic Algorithm project!
