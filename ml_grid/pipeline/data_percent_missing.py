    This function identifies columns to be dropped based on a pre-calculated
    dictionary of missing data percentages. It expects a file named
    'percent_missing_dict.pickle' in the root directory. It compares the
    missing percentage of each column from this file against a threshold
    specified in `local_param_dict`.

    Args:
        local_param_dict: A dictionary of parameters for the current pipeline,
            expected to contain the 'percent_missing' threshold.
        all_df_columns: A list of all column names in the dataframe to be processed.
        drop_list: The list of columns already marked for dropping. This list
            will be extended with columns that exceed the missing data threshold.

    Returns:
        The updated list of columns to be dropped from the dataframe.
