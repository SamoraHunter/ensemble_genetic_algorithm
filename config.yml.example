# Example Configuration for the Ensemble Genetic Algorithm Project

# To use this file, copy it to `config.yml` in your project's root
# directory and uncomment/edit the parameters you wish to change.
# Any parameter not specified here will use its hardcoded default value.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Global Parameters ---
# These settings control the overall behavior of the experiment.
# Corresponds to attributes in `ml_grid.util.global_params.global_parameters`.
global_params:
  # Verbosity level for console output (0-9).
  # Default: 3
  # verbose: 3

  # If True, raises exceptions during grid search; otherwise, logs them.
  # Default: True
  # error_raise: True

  # Number of parallel jobs for grid search. -1 uses all available cores.
  # Default: 4
  # grid_n_jobs: 8

  # Time in seconds after which a warning is printed for long model training times.
  # Default: 60
  # model_train_time_warning_threshold: 120

  # Number of generations without improvement before the GA stops early.
  # Default: 5
  # gen_eval_score_threshold_early_stopping: 10

  # If True, saves trained base learners to disk. Can use a lot of space.
  # This is also configurable per-run in `grid_params`.
  # Default: True
  # store_base_learners: True

# --- Genetic Algorithm Parameters ---
# These control the evolution process itself (population size, generations, etc.).
# Corresponds to attributes in `ml_grid.util.grid_param_space_ga.Grid`.
ga_params:
  # List of possible values for the number of base learners in an ensemble.
  # Default: [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
  # nb_params: [8, 16]

  # List of possible values for the population size.
  # Default: [32, 64]
  # pop_params: [50]

  # List of possible values for the number of generations.
  # Default: [128]
  # g_params: [100]

# --- Grid Search Hyperparameters ---
# This section defines the search space for each experiment iteration.
# Corresponds to the `grid` dictionary in `ml_grid.util.grid_param_space_ga.Grid`.
grid_params:
  # --- Ensemble & Preprocessing Parameters ---
  # Methods for weighting base learner predictions. Options: "ann", "de", "unweighted".
  # Default: ["ann", "de", "unweighted"]
  # weighted: ["unweighted"]

  # Whether to reuse stored base learners from previous runs.
  # Default: [False]
  # use_stored_base_learners: [True]

  # Whether to store newly trained base learners to disk for this run.
  # Default: [False]
  # store_base_learners: [True]

  # Resampling methods for imbalanced data. Options: "undersample", "oversample", None.
  # Default: ["undersample", "oversample", None]
  # resample: ["undersample", None]

  # Whether to scale features.
  # Default: [True]
  # scale: [True, False]

  # --- Feature Selection Parameters ---
  # Correlation threshold for removing columns.
  # Default: [0.9, 0.99]
  # corr: [0.95]

  # Percentage of missing data allowed in a column before it's removed.
  # Default: [99.9, 99.8, 99.7]
  # percent_missing: [99.0]

  # --- Genetic Algorithm Hyperparameters (per grid search run) ---
  # Crossover probability.
  # Default: [0.5, 0.75, 0.25]
  # cxpb: [0.8]

  # Mutation probability.
  # Default: [0.2, 0.4, 0.8]
  # mutpb: [0.15]

  # Probability of individual gene mutation.
  # Default: [0.025, 0.05, 0.075]
  # indpb: [0.05]

  # Tournament size for selection.
  # Default: [3, 6, 9]
  # t_size: [5]

  # --- Data Feature Selection ---
  # This nested dictionary controls which groups of features are included in the search space.
  # You can override specific feature groups.
  # data:
  #   - bloods: [True] # Example: Force inclusion of bloods data
  #     diagnostic_order: [False] # Example: Force exclusion of diagnostic orders
  #     # Default for bloods is [True, False]
  #     # Default for diagnostic_order is [True, False]
